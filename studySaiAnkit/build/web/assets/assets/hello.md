## Differential Equations

#### Introduction

A differential Equation is an equation that contains a derivative ( or deriavtives ) of an unknown function. It involves differential co-efficients.

Differential Equations are divided into two parts based on number of indepenednt variables:

- Ordinary Differential Equation
---
  - An ODE is a differential equation that involves the ordinary derivatives or differentials of only a single indepenednt variable.
  - Eg : $\frac{dy}{dx} = 2x$ , $\frac{d^2y}{d^2x} = -\mu y$
---
- Partial Differential Equation

  - A PDE is a differential equation is a differential equation that involves the partial derivatives of two or more independent variables

  - Eg : $a^2.\frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial x^2} = \frac{\partial w}{\partial t}$ ==Heat Equation==

    
    

**<u>Order of Differential Equation :</u>** 
It is the order of the highest differential co-efficient that occurs in the equation. 
<u>**Degree of Differential Equation :**</u>
It is the power of highest differential co-efficient provided the equation is free from fractional powers.

| Example                                                      | Order | Degree |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----- | ------ |
| $[1+(\frac{dy}{dx})^2]^{3/2} = (\frac{d^2y}{dx^2})$          | 2     | 2      |
| $\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + 2(\frac{dy}{dx})^2 + y = 0$             | 2     | 1      |
| $\frac{\partial ^2z}{\partial x^2}$ + $\frac{\partial ^2z}{\partial y^2} = 0$ | 2     | 1      |
| $(\frac{dy}{dx})^{3/2} = (\frac{d^2y}{dx^2})^{2/3}$          | 2     | 4      |

**Formation of Differential Equation**
Differential Equations are formed by elimination of arbitrary constants / functions from a relation in variables and constants. 

**Solution of Differential Equation**
An equation in terms of the variables which satisfies the given differential equation is called solution of DE. 




Differential Equations are also classified into :

- Linear Differential Equation
  - A DE is said to be linear when the dependent variable, all the deriavtives of it appear only in the 1st degree and no multiplication between them.
